# What's this Repo for?

I use this repo to send commands & recieve Protobuf commands in order to test my EPS Software, which runs on a microcontroller.
See [../eps](../eps) for more information on the target I'm testing

## How to use this?

This software is designed to run on your desktop/laptop. I simply use `cargo run` to test. This assumes you have a USB-to-Serial adapter connected to your microcontroller target.
