# Where did these files come from?

I copied these openocd configuration files out of an SW4STM32 Eclipse ICD install plugins directory.

The hardcoded path was: `/path/to/install/Ac6/SystemWorkbench/plugins/fr.ac6.mcu.debug_2.5.0.201904120827/resources/openocd/`

## OpenOCD Compatibility

> These files are desingned to run with a version of OpenOCD that ships with SW4STM32. Specifically, that's version `v0.10.0-dev-00021-g524e8c8`. I suspect this is modified version. OpenOCD files may not work if running with another version of Openocd! I tried `v0.10.0` and that did not work.
